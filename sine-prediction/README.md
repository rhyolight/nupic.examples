# Sine Wave Prediction

* * *

> This is a work-in-progress. 

* * *

This experiment will generate sine wave data into a csv file, then run a swarm against it. The model params generated by the swarm will be used to run NuPIC to predict the sine wave. Output by default will be plotted to `matplotlib`.

## Requirements for plotting

* matplotlib

You have to have matplotlib installed for the `NuPICPlotOutput` class to work. If you don't, you can replace it with `NuPICFileOutput`, which will write the output to a file instead.

## Writing output to file

In `sine_experiment.py`, change:

    output = NuPICPlotOutput("sine_output", show_anomaly_score=False)

to:

    output = NuPICFileOutput("sine_output", show_anomaly_score=False)

## To Run:

    python sine_experiment.py
